# dust-collection
The goal is so we can connect dust producing power tools to the central dust collection system.

There are several 100 mm diameter access ports in the workshop.

1. Each port will get a plastic insert with a magnetic flange.
2. The second part has a matching magnetic flange and a CAMLOCK [Created by PeterH](https://www.printables.com/@PeterH) connector on the other end.
3. Hoses with CAMLOCK connectors both ends grant flexibility and reconfiguration.
4. Final pieces in the line are specific CAMLOCK adapters for each machine.

With this setup we can use the right length hose for the job... and it is fun to overcomplicate things. :D

The custom adapter models are drawn in OpenSCAD using [ostat's library](https://github.com/ostat/vacuum-hose-adapter-openscad).
